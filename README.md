The soŌware development process is becoming more complex, and lack of budget and resources is a common challenge. Crowdfunding is an advantageous soluƟon that many non-profits and businesses are using to rally support around their ideas. The 'Buy Me A Soda' Web3 App offers creators, educators, and entertainers a plaƞorm to receive digital currency as a thank you for their services. Crowdfunding beats banks and ventures on many fronts as it offers a less risky and more secure opƟon without requiring extensive agreements and signatures. Our project offers accessibility and avoids the disadvantages of small business loans altogether.
